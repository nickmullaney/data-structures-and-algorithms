# binary-search
Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of finding the middle of the array and using that to determine if the value more towards the beginning or the end of the array. Then it narrows it down and continues searching that until it finds the value. If it doesn't then it will return -1
